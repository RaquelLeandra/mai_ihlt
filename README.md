The goal of this course is to provide the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the student. Concretely, the course is an introduction to the most relevant drawbacks involved in NLP, the most relevant techniques and resources used to tackle with them, and the theories they are based on. In addition, brief descriptions of the most relevant NLP applications are included. The course will focus on knowledge-based and empirical-based approaches to NLP (both statistical and machine learning).
